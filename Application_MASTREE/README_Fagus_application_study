#Study Case: Climate Cue Detection in European Beech (Fagus sylvatica)
This folder contains materials and code related to a case study on Fagus sylvatica (European beech), 
demonstrating the application of the weatheRcues R package for detecting climatic drivers of mast seeding.

Contents
ðŸ”¹ - study_case_fagus.R
This is the main script for running the case study. It connects to and utilizes functions from the weatheRcues package to analyze climate-biological interactions.

ðŸ”¹ - Additional_functions_application_mastree.R
This script contains helper functions specific to this case study, which are not part of the core weatheRcues package.

ðŸ”¹ - climate_dailEOBS/
This folder includes daily climate data for each study site. Data were extracted from E-OBS v28
(https://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php). Files are in .qs format. 
File names correspond to the latitude and longitude of each site.

ðŸ”¹ - mastree_data_copy/
This folder contains a copy of the Mastree+ dataset
(https://github.com/JJFoest/MASTREEplus; for the article reference see Hacket-Pain et al https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16130).
File format: .csv

ðŸ”¹ - figures/
Contains visual output from the study: 15 .png files presenting the main results of the analysis.

ðŸ”¹ - output/
Includes model output generated by the main script, such as: Results from block cross-validation and Robustness testing of climate cue detection
