\arguments{
\item{lag}{Integer. The number of data points to consider for calculating thresholds in the thresholding algorithm (default is 100).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. The threshold for triggering signals in the \code{ThresholdingAlgo} function (default is 3).}

\item{influence}{Numeric. The influence of new signals on the algorithm; set to 0 to avoid influence (default is 0).}

\item{tolerancedays}{Integer. The number of days for gap tolerance when identifying sequences (default is 7).}

\item{refday}{Integer. The reference day for climate data (default is 305).}

\item{lastdays}{Integer. The total number of days used for the analysis (default is 600).}

\item{rollwin}{Integer. The size of the rolling window for climate data smoothing (default is 1).}

\item{siteforsub}{String. The unique identifier for the site (e.g., longitude and latitude).}

\item{Results_CSPsub}{A data frame containing the results of a CSP method for a specific site, including slope and R-squared values.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing biological data (e.g., seed production) with columns such as \code{plotname.lon.lat} and \code{Year}.}

\item{climate.beech.path}{String. The path to the directory containing the climate data.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the fitted model for each identified weather cue window. If no signals are detected, the function will return a message indicating that no windows were identified.
}
\description{
This function identifies weather cues based on the \code{ThresholdingAlgo} for a specific site. It computes the relationship between slope and R-squared of a CSP method result, applies a thresholding algorithm to detect signal changes, and analyzes the climate data using a rolling window.
}
\details{
The function applies the thresholding algorithm to detect signals from the product of slope and R-squared values from a CSP analysis. Identified signals are used to extract sequences of days, and these sequences are analyzed with respect to climate data using a rolling window approach.
