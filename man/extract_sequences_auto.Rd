\title{Extract Sequences of Numbers with Tolerated Gaps}
\usage{
extract_sequences_auto(vec, tolerance)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{Numeric vector. A vector of values (e.g., days or indices). The vector does not need to be pre-sorted.}

\item{tolerance}{Integer. The maximum allowed gap between values for them to be considered part of the same sequence. For instance, a \code{tolerance = 2} means values up to 2 units apart are grouped.}
}
\value{
A list of numeric vectors. Each vector represents a detected sequence where gaps between elements do not exceed the specified tolerance.
}
\description{
This function identifies sequences of nearly consecutive values from a numeric vector, allowing for small gaps between values (defined by a tolerance). It is particularly useful for detecting temporally clustered events (e.g., climate signal windows) with some missing or noisy data.

\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Sorts the input vector.
\item Iterates through values, grouping them into sub-vectors if they are within \code{tolerance} of each other.
\item Returns a list of these sub-vectors (i.e., sequences).
}
Useful in time-series applications for identifying signal windows or event clusters with small interruptions.

\examples{
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12)
extract_sequences_auto(vec, tolerance = 1)
# Returns: list(c(1, 2, 3), c(6, 7), c(10, 11, 12))

vec2 <- c(3, 5, 6, 9)
extract_sequences_auto(vec2, tolerance = 2)
# Returns: list(c(3, 5, 6), c(9))
