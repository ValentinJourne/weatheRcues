\title{Transform Response Variable for Use in Beta Regression}
\usage{
y_transformation_betareg(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector. The response variable to be transformed. Can contain missing values (NA), which will be excluded from the computation of \eqn{n}, but preserved in the output.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{y}, with values transformed to lie within (0, 1), suitable for use in beta regression.
}
\description{
This function rescales a numeric response variable to ensure all values lie strictly within the (0, 1) interval,
as required by beta regression models. It uses the common transformation:
}
\details{
\deqn{y' = \frac{y \cdot (n - 1) + 0.5}{n}}

where \eqn{n} is the number of non-missing observations in \eqn{y}. This ensures that no values are exactly 0 or 1,
which would otherwise cause errors in beta regression.
}
\note{
This transformation is especially useful prior to fitting models using \code{\link[betareg]{betareg}}.
}
\examples{
y <- c(0.0, 0.5, 1.0, NA, 0.3)
y_transformed <- y_transformation_betareg(y)
print(y_transformed)
